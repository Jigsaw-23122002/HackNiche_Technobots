## A secure & efficient solution for Certificate Verification
DeCerts is a blockchain-based application that will store and verify documents issued by the college to the students. Before uploading the file on IPFS, a QR Code is generated which is then embedded in the document. Issuance of certain documents, for instance an academic transcript requires a fee of Rs. 400. Whenever a third party(University/Company) wants to verify the document, they can scan the QR Code and verify it. There is a small fee associated with the verification process.   
Biconomy has been used to implement Gasless transactions and IPFS to store the documents.

## Problems with the current system

- Companies/Universities are concerned whether a certificate provided to them is legit or forged.
- Manual verification/offline visits is a tedious procedure and takes weeks to complete. 
- Use of physical documents is also inconvenient and inefficient in today‚Äôs fast paced digital world.
- Physical documents can be misplaced easily.

## How we aim to solve these problems

- Use of blockchain to maintain integrity and for authentication.
- Use of IPFS storage to store all the documents digitally on a decentralized network.
- Automation of the verification system using QR code.
- Use of celo Testnet network for deployment of the contract and performnig Transactions.
